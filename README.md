# Pro-Bono-Client-Project---NLP-Content-Recommender

As my capstone project during my GA Data Science Immersive I worked with a small startup on an NLP/recommender assignment. The project was pro bono and was a great opportunity to work with a real-life data.

The data itself is proprietary but we agreed that I can share most of the code in my github portfolio. The cells won't run without the code but would give an idea of the steps and code used.
